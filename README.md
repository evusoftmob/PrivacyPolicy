#### Last updated: February 17, 2022
This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of information when using the Apps.

We don't use or store any of the users personal information or data. We only use Google Firebase in order to identify crashes on the Apps (when they occur) and the only information that It gives us, is the Brand, Model and Android version of the smartphone and the crash on the code itself. This is the basics to pinpoint the problem and solve It. Other than this we don't collect or store data. Every data used on the Apps are stored on the smartphone itself and can be erased any point in time.
#### Links to Other Apps

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
